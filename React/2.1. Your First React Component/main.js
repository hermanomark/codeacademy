// Hello World, Part II... THE COMPONENT
// React applications are made out of components.

// What's a component?

// A component is a small, reusable chunk of code that is responsible for one job. That job is often to render some HTML.

// Take a look at the code below. This code will create and render a new React component:

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

class MyComponentClass extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
  }
};

ReactDOM.render(<MyComponentClass />, document.getElementById('app'));

// A lot of that code is probably unfamiliar. However you can recognize some JSX in there, as well as ReactDOM.render().

// We are going to unpack that code, one small piece at a time. By the end of this lesson, you'll understand how to build a React component!

// ------------------------------------------------------------

// Import React
// Wooo! Your first React component!

// Take a look at the code on line 1:

import React from 'react';
// This line of code creates a new variable. That variable's name is React, and its value is a particular, imported JavaScript object:

// create a variable named React:
import React from 'react';
// evaluate this variable and get a particular, imported JavaScript object:
React // { imported object properties here... }
// This imported object contains methods that you need in order to use React. The object is called the React library.

// Later, we'll go over where the React library is imported from, and how the importing process works. For now, just know that you get the React library via import React from 'react';.

// You've already seen one of the methods contained in the React library: React.createElement(). Recall that when a JSX element is compiled, it transforms into a React.createElement() call.

// For this reason, you have to import the React library, and save it in a variable named React, before you can use any JSX at all. React.createElement() must be available in order for JSX to work.

// Sample:
import React from 'react';

// ------------------------------------------------------------
// Import ReactDOM
// Now take a look at the code on line 2:

import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
// This line of code is very similar to line 1.

// Lines 1 and 2 both import JavaScript objects. In both lines, the imported object contains React-related methods.

// However, there is a difference!

// The methods imported from 'react-dom' are meant for interacting with the DOM. You are already familiar with one of them: ReactDOM.render().

// The methods imported from 'react' don't deal with the DOM at all. They don't engage directly with anything that isn't part of React.

// To clarify: the DOM is used in React applications, but it isn't part of React. After all, the DOM is also used in countless non-React applications. Methods imported from 'react' are only for pure React purposes, such as creating components or writing JSX elements.

// Sample
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

// ------------------------------------------------------------
// Create a Component Class
// You've learned that a React component is a small, reusable chunk of code that is responsible for one job, which often involves rendering HTML.

// Here's another fact about components: every component must come from a component class.

// A component class is like a factory that creates components. If you have a component class, then you can use that class to produce as many components as you want.

// To make a component class, you use a base class from the React library: React.Component.

// What is React.Component, and how do you use it to make a component class?

// React.Component is a JavaScript class. To create your own component class, you must subclass React.Component. You can do this by using the syntax class YourComponentNameGoesHere extends React.Component {}.

// JavaScript classes and subclassing are a complex topic beyond the scope of this course. If you aren't comfortable with them, here are some good resources to consult: 1 2 3 4.
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes
// https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/07/es6-in-depth-classes/
// https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/08/es6-in-depth-subclassing/
// http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_classes.html

// Look at the code in app.js. A lot it is still unfamiliar, but you can understand more than you could before!

// On line 4, you know that you are declaring a new component class, which is like a factory for building React components. You know that React.Component is a class, which you must subclass in order to create a component class of your own. You also know that React.Component is a property on the object which was returned by import React from 'react' on line 1.

// Sample
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

class x extends React.Component {

}

// ------------------------------------------------------------
// Name a Component Class
// Good! Subclassing React.Component is the way to declare a new component class.

// When you declare a new component class, you need to give that component class a name. On line 4, notice that our component class's name is MyComponentClass.

// Component class variable names must begin with capital letters!

// This adheres to JavaScript's class syntax. It also adheres to a broader programming convention in which class names are written in UpperCamelCase. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming)#Java)

// In addition, there is a React-specific reason why component class names must always be capitalized. We'll get to that soon!

// Sample
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

class MyComponentClass extends React.Component {

};

// ------------------------------------------------------------
// Component Class Instructions
// Let's review what you've learned so far! Find each of these points in app.js:

// On line 1, import React from 'react' creates a JavaScript object. This object contains properties that are needed to make React work, such as React.createElement() and React.Component.

// On line 2, import ReactDOM from 'react-dom' creates another JavaScript object. This object contains methods that help React interact with the DOM, such as ReactDOM.render().

// On line 4, by subclassing React.Component, you create a new component class. This is not a component! A component class is more like a factory that produces components. When you start making components, each one will come from a component class.

// Whenever you create a component class, you need to give that component class a name. That name should be written in UpperCamelCase. In this case, your chosen name is MyComponentClass.

// Something that we haven't talked about yet is the body of your component class: the pair of curly braces after React.Component, and all of the code between those curly braces.

// Like all JavaScript classes, this one needs a body. The body will act as a set of instructions, explaining to your component class how it should build a React component.

// Here's what your class body would look like on its own, without the rest of the class declaration syntax. Find it in app.js:

{
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
  }
}
// That doesn't look like a set of instructions explaining how to build a React component! Yet that's exactly what it is.

// Click Next, and we'll go into how these instructions work.

// ------------------------------------------------------------
// The Render Function
// A component class is like a factory that builds components. It builds these components by consulting a set of instructions, which you must provide. Let's talk about these instructions!

// For starters, these instructions should take the form of a class declaration body. That means that they will be delimited by curly braces, like this:

class ComponentFactory extends React.Component {
    // instructions go here, between the curly braces
}
// The instructions should be written in typical JavaScript ES2015 class syntax.

// There is only one property that you have to include in your instructions: a render method.

// A render method is a property whose name is render, and whose value is a function. The term "render method" can refer to the entire property, or to just the function part.

class ComponentFactory extends React.Component {
  render() {}
}
// A render method must contain a return statement. Usually, this return statement returns a JSX expression:

class ComponentFactory extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
  }
}
// Of course, none of this explains the point of a render method. All you know so far is that its name is render, it needs a return statement for some reason, and you have to include it in the body of your component class declaration. We'll get to the 'why' of it soon!

//Sample
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

class MyComponentClass extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
  }
}

// ------------------------------------------------------------
// Create a Component Instance
// MyComponentClass is now a working component class! It's ready to follow its instructions and make some React components.

// So, let's make a React component! It only takes one more line:

<MyComponentClass />
// To make a React component, you write a JSX element. Instead of naming your JSX element something like h1 or div like you've done before, give it the same name as a component class. Voilà, there's your component instance!

// JSX elements can be either HTML-like, or component instances. JSX uses capitalization to distinguish between the two! That is the React-specific reason why component class names must begin with capital letters. In a JSX element, that capitalized first letter says, "I will be a component instance and not an HTML tag."

// Sample
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

class MyComponentClass extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
  }
}

<MyComponentClass />

// ------------------------------------------------------------
// Render A Component
// You have learned that a component class needs a set of instructions, which tell the component class how to build components. When you make a new component class, these instructions are the body of your class declaration:

// class MyComponentClass extends React.Component
{ // everything in between these curly-braces is instructions for how to build components

  render() {
    return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
  }
}
// This class declaration results in a new component class, in this case named MyComponentClass. MyComponentClass has one method, named render. This all happens via standard JavaScript class syntax.

// You haven't learned how these instructions actually work to make components! When you make a component by using the expression <MyComponentClass />, what do these instructions do?

// Whenever you make a component, that component inherits all of the methods of its component class. MyComponentClass has one method: MyComponentClass.render(). Therefore, <MyComponentClass /> also has a method named render.

// You could make a million different <MyComponentClass /> instances, and each one would inherit this same exact render method.

// This lesson's final exercise is to render your component. In order to render a component, that component needs to have a method named render. Your component has this! It inherited a method named render from MyComponentClass.

// Since your component has a render method, all that's left to do is call it. This happens in a slightly unusual way.

// To call a component's render method, you pass that component to ReactDOM.render(). Notice your component, being passed as ReactDOM.render()'s first argument:

ReactDOM.render(
  <MyComponentClass />,
  document.getElementById('app')
);
// ReactDOM.render() will tell <MyComponentClass /> to call its render method.

// <MyComponentClass /> will call its render method, which will return the JSX element <h1>Hello world</h1>. ReactDOM.render() will then take that resulting JSX element, and add it to the virtual DOM. This will make "Hello world" appear on the screen.

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

class MyComponentClass extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
  }
}

// component goes here:
ReactDOM.render(<MyComponentClass />, document.getElementById('app'));

// ------------------------------------------------------------
