Video Player
You just learned your first programming pattern. Let's put it to use!

For this project, you'll make three React components work together to create a responsive video player. Let's get started!

1.
Click Save, and take a look at your video player in the browser. It looks pretty good! But if you try interacting with it, you'll find that there's zero functionality.

Take a look at the App component class. This class has one property stored as state: a src containing the address of a video file. App's job is to pass this src down to a stateless component, and to pass the ability to change the src down to a different stateless component.

Passing src is the easier part, so let's do that first.

Inside of App's render function, give <Video /> an attribute. Make this attribute's name src, and the attribute's value equal to the src property stored in this.state.

2.
Let's make <Video /> play its passed-in video file!

Select Video.js. In Video's render function, give <video /> a src attribute. Make src equal to the passed-in video file.

3.
Alright, the video player works! Now let's make the menu work as well.

You've made App pass the src down to <Video />. Now App needs to pass the ability to change the src down to <Menu />. If you want to pass the ability to change a piece of state, then first you need to define a function that calls this.setState.

In App.js, give App a new property named chooseVideo. Set chooseVideo's value equal to a function with one parameter, named newVideo.

chooseVideo is going to get passed a string: either 'fast', 'slow', 'cute', or 'eek'. It will use this string to choose a new src, which it will use to update this.state.src.

In the body of chooseVideo, call this.setState. Set this.state.src equal to VIDEOS[newVideo].

4.
If you pass chooseVideo to <Menu />, then you will give <Menu /> the ability to update <App />'s state.

In App's render function , give Menu a chooseVideo attribute. Set chooseVideo's value equal to the chooseVideo function.

5.
Currently, if you pass .chooseVideo() to Menu the value of this will be incorrect when called. In the constructor of App, bind .chooseVideo() to the current value of this and store it in this.chooseVideo.

6.
Alright, now you just have to attach this passed-in function to an event listener!

Select Menu.js. In Menu's render function, give <form></form> an onClick attribute. Set onClick's value equal to the passed-in chooseVideo function.

7.
Try selecting a video in the browser.

It doesn't work! Do you know why not?

chooseVideo expects a string as an argument. But event handlers are automatically passed event objects, not strings.

You need to wrap chooseVideo in a new function that can take an event object as an argument.

Give Menu a new property, before the render function, named handleClick. Set handleClick equal to a function with one parameter named e.

Inside of the body of handleClick, declare a new variable named text. Set text equal to e.target.value. This will equal the text of a clicked radio button.

After declaring this text variable, create a new line. On your new line, call the passed-in chooseVideo function. Pass in text as an argument.

8.
Currently, the value of this will be incorrect when you call .handleClick().

Create a constructor for Menu, and in its body, call super(props). Then, bind .handleClick() to the current value of this and store it in this.handleClick.

9.
Only one more step! You need to use your new wrapper function as an event handler.

In Menu's render function's return statement, replace {this.props.chooseVideo} with {this.handleClick}.

10.
Great job!

App passes down this.state.src to Video. Video uses this info to display the chosen video.

App also passes down the ability to change this.state.src to Menu. Menu uses this ability to let a user to select a new video.

You've put together a responsive video player, and done it in a way that you will often find in the real world!
