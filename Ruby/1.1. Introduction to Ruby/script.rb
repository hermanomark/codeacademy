#Everything in ruby is an object
#Ruby has certain built-in abilities called methods
#You can think of methods as "skills" that certain objects have

#length method
puts "Mark Hermano".length
# ==> 12

#Reverse method
puts "Mark".reverse
# ==>kraM

#uppercase and downcase
puts "mark".upcase
puts "MARK".downcase
# ==> Mark
# ==> MARK

Naming convetions
By convention, these variables should start with a lowercase
letter and words should be separated by underscores, like counter and masterful_method
sample:
mark = "Mark Hermano"
=end

#Variables and Data types
my_name = "Mark Hermano" #String
my_age = 22 #Integer

print "#{my_name} #{my_age}" #Displaying Variables

#Math
puts sum = 13 + 379
puts product = 923 * 15
puts quotient = 13209 / 17

#Chaining method
puts "string".downcase.reverse.upcase
